<h2>2: Hello World!</h2>
<i>Extremely short but remember, this is an intro still</i>
<h3>Create project</h3>
<p>Start up PyCharm and create a new Project and name it PythonTutorial
<h3>Create file and code!</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Once the project is created, make a new file and title it, helloworld.py
    </li>
    <li>
        On line 1, type the following:
        
        {% highlight python %}
            print("Hello World!")
        {% endhighlight %}
    </li>
    <li>
        On the taskbar, find Run then click Run.
    </li>
    <li>
        A window should appear and it should say "Hello World"
    </li>
</ol>
<p> You've just built your first python program. It's small and simple but baby steps.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b></p>
<p>It's fairly easy to get lost in this so reach out to me or google, whenever you have a question. I may not know the answer
    but I'll find out for you.<small>Worst case scenario: Google it.</small></p>

<h2>1: Setting up</h2>
<i>This one is going to be annoying.</i>
</br></br>

<h3>Windows:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Get python3.8.2 from here:
            <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/">Get Python3.8.2</a>

        Choose the Windows x86-64 web-based installer and go through the installation. If at one point it asks if you 
        want to disable a MAX_PATH limitation, do it. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Download a program called “pycharm community edition.” 
            - From <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows">Get PyCharm for Windows</a>
        Download the free one.
    </li>
    <li>
        When installing pycharm, it’ll ask you to check some installation options. Just select “create desktop shortcut” and 
        “create associations.” Click continue and let the installer run. 
    
        When it finishes, click the option that says Run PyCharm Community Edition and then finish.
    </li>
    <li>
        At some point it’ll give two options, click the one that says “Do not import settings” 
        Agree to the terms if you agree, I guess
        Then click “Skip the remaining set to defaults” option when it’s prompted.
    </li>
</ol>

</br>
<h3>Apple Mac OSX</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Python comes preinstalled so no need to install it
    </li>
    <li>
        Download a program called “pycharm community edition.” 
            - From <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac">Get PyCharm for Mac</a>
        Download the free one.
    </li>
    <li>
        Run the installer and let the installer run. 
    </li>
    <li>
        When pycharm finishes installing, look for and run the program. It should be in your applications folder. 
    </li>
    <li>
        At some point it’ll give two options, click the one that says “Do not import settings” 
        Agree to the terms if you agree, I guess
        Then click “Skip the remaining set to defaults” option when it’s prompted. 
    </li>
</ol></br>
