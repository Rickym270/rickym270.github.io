                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Find the commit you want to revert to and get the first 7 characters of the commit_SHA.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Run <span class="git-command-inline">git reset &lt;commit_SHA&gt;</span> to revert back.

                        Typically, the working branch name, if no other branch is created, is called master. Branches are created to test out different versions of the same project.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The circles are commits, and together form the Git project's commit history.

                        Git has tools that make it easier to collaborate with others on a project.
                        
                        Git handles the necessary to collaborate effectively:
                        
                        <ol class="git-command-list">
                            <li>Replicates project on users computer</li>
                            <li>Tracks and allows for review of each other's work</li>
                            <li>Access to project version</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        
                        
                        All of this is accomplished using remotes which allows collaborators to work on a project from different locations, independently. Later, just merge.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a merge is necessary to merge changes that have been made (present in origin/master) into the master branch.
