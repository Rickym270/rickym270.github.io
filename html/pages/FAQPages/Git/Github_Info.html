                        Git is an incredibly useful tool that is used for version control. It is a standard and is commonly used by web developers to keep track of changes made in a project. The repository has two areas: staging, working:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working area - this is your local directory where files are being changed and testing
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staging area - where changes are kept, ready to be pushed into the repository
                        
                        
                        
                        <div class='divider'></div></br>
                                <h4>Useful Commands</h4>
                        
                        
                        
                        git init - Creates a new git repository
                        
                        git status - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
                        
                        git add - adds files from the working directory to the staging area
                        
                        git diff - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
                        
                        git commit - permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
                        
                        git log - shows a list of all previous commits
                        
                        
                        
                        <div class='divider'></div></br>
                                <h4>Backtracking</h4>
                        
                        
                        
                        HEAD - Refers to the most recent commit that has been made in the repository. This can be viewed by running:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git show HEAD
                        
                        
                        
                        Discarding a change
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git diff
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It is recommended to do a ```git diff``` to see how the current file and differs from the previous commit
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git checkout HEAD <filename>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If there is a change in a file that was made, and now the change needs to be discarded, you can run:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  git checkout HEAD <filename>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use the above command to discard changes made to a file in your working directory.
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: This does not reset files that have been pushed already. This all takes place in the working area of the workflow.
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git reset HEAD <filename>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If a change was made, and that change is added into the staging area by accident, you can reset the HEAD to remove the change from the STAGING AREA.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: This does not discard the change made on the working file, just the change that is reflected in the HEAD commit.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: In output, M is short for "modification"
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git reset <commit_SHA>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To go back on changes, run git log to view all previous commits.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Find the commit you want to revert to and get the first 7 characters of the commit_SHA.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Run git reset <commit_SHA> to revert back. This reassigns HEAD to be what it was in the commit that was selected
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before reset:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEAD is at the most recent commit
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After resetting:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEAD goes to a previously made commit of your choice
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray commits are no longer part of your project
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have in essence rewound the project's history

                                <h4>Branching</h4>
                        
                        
                        
                        Typically, the working branch name, if no other branch is created, is called master. Branches are created to test out different versions of the same project.
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git branch
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- returns the name of the branch you are currently on. This is delimited by an asterisk
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The above describes how branches work in relation to the project.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The circles are commits, and together form the Git project's commit history.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- New Branch is a different version of the Git project. It contains commits from Master but also has commits that Master does not have.
                        
                        
                        
                        CREATING A NEW Branch
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git branch <new_branch>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use this command to create a branch.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  CONVENTION: This branch should be named something that describes its purpose. NO WHITESPACES!
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        git checkout <branch name>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Used to switch branches.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - b

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: in the above case, if switching from branch A to Branch B, the file will reflect that file C is not present because it doesn't exist in Branch B (even though it exists in Branch A).
                        
                        
                        
                        git merge
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To merge cahnges made on one branch into the master branch, you merge them.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  git merge <branch name>
                        
                        
                        
                        merge conflict
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Merges are typically successful because there should be no changes made on the master branch unless it's going to production.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If a commit is done:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- on master before the branches were merged, git doesn't know which changes to keep.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- On Branch B File a Line 20, and on Branch A, File a Line 20
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called a merge conflict. Error messages are as follows:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in resumé.txt

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve, remove conflict from master branch, then add the file to the staging area and commit it. THEN merge.
                        
                        
                        
                        delete branch

                        NOTE: Branches are meant to be deleted unless there is a new feature that is currently being developed. Once the branch is done, it has completed its use and can be deleted.

                        Git has tools that make it easier to collaborate with others on a project.
                        
                        Git handles the necessary to collaborate effectively:

                        git fetch
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When collaborating, it is necessary to be up-to-date with any changes that were made by other collaborators.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fetch to bring any changes into your local copy.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: This does not merge changes into the local repository. It creates a remote branch
                        
                        
                        
                        git merge <remote branch> <master branch>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall the remote branch. Changes made by collaborators have been fetched and are visible in a branch called origin/master. This is not the same as the master branch.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a merge is necessary to merge changes that have been made (present in origin/master) into the master branch.
                        
                        
                        
                        git push origin <branch_name>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushes changes made by a user up to the remote, origin. From there, the owner of the repo can review the changes, and merge the work into the master branch
