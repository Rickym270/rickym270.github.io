                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If there is a change in a file that was made, and now the change needs to be discarded, you can run:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  git checkout HEAD <filename>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use the above command to discard changes made to a file in your working directory.
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: This does not reset files that have been pushed already. This all takes place in the working area of the workflow.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If a change was made, and that change is added into the staging area by accident, you can reset the HEAD to remove the change from the STAGING AREA.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: This does not discard the change made on the working file, just the change that is reflected in the HEAD commit.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: In output, M is short for "modification"

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To go back on changes, run git log to view all previous commits.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Find the commit you want to revert to and get the first 7 characters of the commit_SHA.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Run git reset <commit_SHA> to revert back. This reassigns HEAD to be what it was in the commit that was selected
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before reset:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEAD is at the most recent commit
                        
                        
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After resetting:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEAD goes to a previously made commit of your choice

                        Typically, the working branch name, if no other branch is created, is called master. Branches are created to test out different versions of the same project.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The above describes how branches work in relation to the project.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The circles are commits, and together form the Git project's commit history.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: in the above case, if switching from branch A to Branch B, the file will reflect that file C is not present because it doesn't exist in Branch B (even though it exists in Branch A).

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To merge cahnges made on one branch into the master branch, you merge them.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Merges are typically successful because there should be no changes made on the master branch unless it's going to production.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If a commit is done:

                        Git handles the necessary to collaborate effectively:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Replicates project on users computer
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Tracks and allows for review of each other's work
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Access to project version
                        
                        
                        
                        All of this is accomplished using remotes which allows collaborators to work on a project from different locations, independently. Later, just merge.
                        
                        
                        
                        Useful commands:
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git remote -v: Lists a Git project's remotes.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git fetch: Fetches work from the remote into the local copy.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git merge origin/master: Merges origin/master into your local branch.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git push origin <branch_name>: Pushes a local branch to the origin remote.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Replicates the repo onto your own computer.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <remote location> can be a filepath or a URL
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <clone name> is the name that will be given to the directory that the repo is being copied to
                        
                        
                        
                        git remote
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- When a clone of a repository is made, a remote address is given to the repository. It is named, origin.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git remote -v

                        git fetch
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When collaborating, it is necessary to be up-to-date with any changes that were made by other collaborators.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fetch to bring any changes into your local copy.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: This does not merge changes into the local repository. It creates a remote branch
                        
                        
                        
                        git merge <remote branch> <master branch>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall the remote branch. Changes made by collaborators have been fetched and are visible in a branch called origin/master. This is not the same as the master branch.
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a merge is necessary to merge changes that have been made (present in origin/master) into the master branch.
                        
                        
                        
                        git push origin <branch_name>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushes changes made by a user up to the remote, origin. From there, the owner of the repo can review the changes, and merge the work into the master branch
