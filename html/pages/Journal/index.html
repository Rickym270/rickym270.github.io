                    <p>It's been a bit over a year since my last update and man, I've been trying to put in work.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now it's definitely not easy because of issues with MS like double vision, forgetfull to the max, paired with other issues like urgency and difficulty walking. There are probably other things but "forgetfull to the max" was not an understatement.</p>
                    
                    <p>But <b><i>it is what it is</i></b> and <b><i>it be like that sometimes</i></b></p>
                    
                    <p>I swear, this is not paid advertisement but I now have a new device called <a href="https://cionic.com/">Cionic</a>. It's a neural sleeve that goes around my leg and it's pretty amazing.
                        
                    <p>This device has allowed me to walk quite a bit. TLDR, it works by stimulating muscles, at the right time, that are used in walking. It can detect where the leg is and sends electrical stimulations to the muscle that is going to be required to take the next step.</p>
                    
                    <p>The electrical stimulations do take a little to get used to but the Cionic Neural Sleeve has an app that allows you to fully customize the way the device work. Too much stimulation? Lower the intensity, frequency or pulse width.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Don't expect to put the sleeve on and start running on day 1.</b> It will improve things like stamina, muscle memory and, my new favorite word, neuroplasticity. I have gone from barely being able to go up 6 stairs to now going up 6-8 flights of stairs with leg weights (3 lbs) on.</p>
                    
                    <p>While this is amazing, one of the things I found truly amazing, I also found amazing the reduction in mental load.</p> 
                    
                    <p><b><i>What is that?</i></b></p>
                    <p>It's basically mental clarity. Previously, when taking a step/walking, I had to think of every single motion my leg was about to take. Lift leg up, flex foot upwards, extend leg out, heel, toes, push off with toes... It's honestly, exhausting to constantly be thinking all that and contributes to exhaustion and the more tired one gets, the more hectic the symptoms get so it's like a double whammy.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>NOW</b>, I still can't run but I can walk so much better now. I was on the verge of progressing to using a wheelchair but the Cionic device helped deter that. I now am able to use a cane now to walk a bit and use the walker to walk the rest of the bit. I do, still, use a walker but I have the ability to use a swing cane and stand longer times.</p>
                    
                    <p>Paired with my PT sessions with <a href="https://www.healthcare4ppl.com/physician/new-york/brooklyn/michael-sansone-1487290391.html">>Michael Sansone</a>, where we go through exercises and stretches that are helpful to me + his great and diverse knowledge of how the body works, walking has become a easier feat.</p>
                    
                    <p>Overall, 10/10 would definitely recommend others to use this device.</p>

                    <div class="push3"></div>
        
                    <p>I recently got a job as a Senior Software Development Engineer in Test! This is extremely exciting and it signals the end of one of my struggles. This opportunity came at the perfect time and, honestly, I am very grateful towards <a href="https://www.medidata.com/en/">Medidata</a> for providing me with such an opportunity to work in the industry!</p>
                    
                    <p>Now the previous months have been extremely difficult for me. I have Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and it sucks. I hate it with a burning passion but "you gotta do what you gotta do." Initially for me, the walking was the thing that gets me annoyed the most. Coming from High School (the start of the "glory" days), I was a pretty active person. Running for miles and miles during winter with the Cross Country team (Flying Dragons) and partaking in Wrestling with Beat the Streets in NYC, I was everywhere and anywhere. Then in college, I was alsod having fun by travelling everywhere on and off the "path" and going out on my late-night extravaganzas. Given that, it hits pretty hard when they tell you that isn't possible anymore. It hits even harder when you, yourself, realize it isn't possible anymore.</p>
                    
                    <p>But, <i>"you gotta do what you gotta do"</i> because <i>"it be like that sometimes"</i> and it sucks but it'll keep sucking if you don't do anything about it. Over the past few months, I've been studying immenseley. From 9AM to 12AM-3AM. Sounds crazy but it is what got me through what I was feeling and allowed me to move forward with everything. I formed little projects that I try to do and it helped to show me:</p>
                    <br>
                        
                    <p><i>Yes, walking and other things are difficult but I have the skill of Software Engineering and Automation so why not use those skills and automate life</i>. Not going to lie, I had moments where I would feel defeated because things weren't working out. I would then look at my projects, accomplishments and abilities, and think "You're obviously good at this. Keep going."</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>The first few weeks were spent trying to figure out how to "learn" efficiently because of the MS. I would try various different "learning" methods and failed/ got annoyed countless times. It's very annoying, the process, but eventually I found one that worked and I stuck to it. It's a method called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#:~:text=Spaced%20repetition%20is%20a%20method,fact%20is%20presented%20or%20said.">Spaced Repetition</a></p>
                    I started finding ways to "automate" my studying and implementing  "Spaced Repetion", using <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>. 
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Once this form of studying proved to be beneficial, I started to practice daily by watching videos and reading documentation. While this is a "good" way to go about it, I found explaining things/concepts in my own words ("English" and even in the other languages I know) was very beneficial. This caused "aha!" moments and I would see why things worked the way they did. Instead of memorizing code, I tried to understand concepts through practice.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <p>That being said, I don't want to come off as a "motivational speaker" but keep trying. It's definitely hard and the figurative tunnel will get pitch dark but it'll happen and you'll get there. Just because it's pitch dark doesn't mean you can't keep going forward. It'll be difficult but not impossible.</p>

                    <p>I know I just started doing this but this "journal" is more of a compilation of random thoughts to aid me and keep track of memories. In case you've skipped the "Home" page, my name is Ricky Martinez. I have always loved to program things, but I guess more abstractly, I have always loved to find out how things work and then make it from scratch. That has been my passion since very young.</p>
                    
                    <p>My father used to get broken, trashed. TVs and take them apart. He would then tell me to look at the mechanisms inside and figure out what was wrong with the TV. Then I would tell him, and he would test it and see if it worked. If it didn't, I'd have to look at it again and figure it out. The incentive? Get a new "better" TV. Thus, was born my enjoyment in "Engineering"</p>
                    
                    <p>If you remember MySpace, you should also remember that you could make/use your own profile "background." This was great and I used to, with the interest of time, copy and paste code (which I later found out was HTML) to set your background. This was really cool and I thought to myself, "Cool, how does it work and can I make it from scratch/modify it?"</p>
                    
                    <p>Fast forward a few years, I attended the High School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College of New York (HSMSE, for short). In my 3rd year, I was placed in Digital Electronics. In that class, programming and Networking was brought up. I believe I was taught beginner Perl. It was simple stuff like a "Hello World" program but the fact that I was able to get the computer to "talk" to me was cool.</p>
                                        
                    <p>Fast forward a few years again, I work at Tradeweb Markets. I spent quite a while here and I learn a lot more here. I work with the Networks team and I develop tools that aid the team in miscellaneous tasks. While here, I learn to build "things” in Python. First, I would get the information by gatheri4ng information from various network devices and save that info into a database. The scripts I built were added as a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+cron+job&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS909US909&oq=define+cron+job&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512j0i22i30l3j0i390l3.4859j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Cron Job</a> to get daily information. Using that information, I'd obtain it, process it and dynamically create a webpage from it, send an email, update a dashboard or do whatever is needed with that data. I could talk about my time here for quite a while but that was the basics.</p>
