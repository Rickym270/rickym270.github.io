                    <p>I know I just started doing this but this "journal" is more of a compilation of random thoughts to aide me and keep track of memories. In case you've skipped the "Home" page, my name is Ricky Martinez. I have always loved to program things, but I guess more abstractly, I have always loved to find out how things work and then make it from scratch. That has been my passion since very young.</p>
                    
                    <p>My fatuer used to get broken, trashed. TVs and take them apart. He would then tell me to look at the mechanisms inside and figure out what was wrong with the TV. Then I would tell him, and he would test it and see if it worked. If it didn't, I'd have to look at it again and figure it out. The incentive? Get a new "better" TV. Thus, was born my enjoyment in "Engineering"</p>
                    
                    <p>If you remember MySpace, you should also remember that you could make/use your own profile "background." This was great and I used to, with the interest of time, copy and paste code (which I later found out was HTML) to set your background. This was really cool and I though to myself, "Cool, how does it work and can I make it from scratch/modify it?"</p>
                    
                    <p>Fast forward a few years, I attended the High School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College of New York (HSMSE, for short). In my 3rd year, I was placed in Digital Electronics. In that class, programming and Networking was brought up. I believe I was taught beginner Perl. It was simple stuff like a "Hello World" program but the fact that I was able to get the computer to "talk" to me was cool.</p>
                                        
                    <p>Fast forward a few years again, I work at Tradeweb Markets. I spend quite a while here and I learn a lot more here. I work with the Networks team and I develop tools that aide the team in miscelleneous tasks. While here, I learn to build "things" in Python. First, I would get the information by gathering information from various network devices and save that info into a database. The scripts I built were added as a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+cron+job&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS909US909&oq=define+cron+job&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512j0i22i30l3j0i390l3.4859j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Cron Job</a> to get daily information. Using that information, I'd obtain it, process it and dynamically create a webpage from it, send an email, update a dashboard or do whatever is needed with that data. I could talk about my time here for quite a while but that was the basics.</p>
