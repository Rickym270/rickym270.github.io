                    Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have <b>s</b> as a prefix.
                    <br><br>

                    For example, given the query string de and the set of strings
                    <br><br>
                    <pre>    [dog, deer, deal]</pre>

                    <pre>    return [deer, deal]</pre>

                    <i>Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    We can go about solving this problem in many ways but one of the more efficientways is to use the Trie data structure. You can read more about it here:
                            <br>
                            <!-- <INSERT LINK HERE> -->
                            <br>
                    The trie works here assuming we "pre-process" the information. It helps for faster lookups. In English:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Trie is like a mental map we have of looking at words:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If we see the word app is being typed, we look at it and might think, This could be the word "appl", but it could also be "apple" or "application" or any word that starts with "appl" for that matter.</li>
                                <li>A Trie defines this structure</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <pre>
                                    a
                                    |
                                    p
                                    |
                                    p

                                   / \
                                  e   i
                                       \
                                        c
                                         \
                                          a
                                           \
                                            t
                                             \
                                              i
                    </pre>
                    As we can tell, at "l", the paths split up to show that the	word could go either way.
                    <ul>
                        <li>To define the Trie, we need to define what a "node"(entry) looks like</li>

                        <li>Notice that at each entry, we have a "knowledge" of it's neighbors
                            <ul>
                                <li>For node "t", it's neighbors are "i" and "a"  so we know we want to keep track of it's neighbors so we define a list
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>For more information on lists, go 
                                            <!-- INSERT LINK --></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We also have a knowledge of whether the current node is the "end" of the word that is being defined by the tree.
                            <ul>
                                <li>By default this isn't "True" because that would mean that a new entry of, say "u", is a word.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Therefore:

                    <pre>
                        <code>
                        class Node:
                            def __init__(self):
                                self.neighbors = []
                                self.is_end = False
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    Now comes the "juicy" part, we need to define the Trie itself
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <pre><code>
                            class Trie:
                                def __init__(self):
                                    self.root = Node()  # The tree should have at least 1 node
                            </code></pre>
                            We need to have at least 1 element in the Trie so we use the previously defined Node to define the Trie and serve as it's "root"
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            We need to define a function to form the Trie from a given word
                            <pre><code>
                                def form_trie(self, word):
                                    for char in word:
                                        if char not in self.root:
                                            self.insert(char)
                            </code></pre>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Here we iterate through every character (letter) in the provided word.</li>
                                <li>We check to see if the current character is not in the Trie already. If not, insert the currect character in there</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            We need to define a function to "insert" also, since it is referenced in the form_trie function.
                            <pre><code>
                                def insert(self, val):
                                    node = self.root
                                    for char in val:
                                        if char not in node.neighbors:
                                            node.neighbors[char] = Node()
                                        node = node.neighbors[char]
                                    node.is_end = True
                            </code></pre>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                     Here we have to have to create a reference to the root node (beginning node)
                                </li>
                                <li>We iterate through the provided value</li>
                                <li>We check if the current element of the provided value is in the neighbors of the node</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If not, we create a Node as a neighbor. Why? Since it doesn't exist, we have to initiate it as a new "entry" or "point" within the Trie</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Set the newly inserted node as the new reference of the node</li>
                                <li>Since we are, currently, "at the end" of the new "word", for all we know, we are at the end so set is_end to True</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
