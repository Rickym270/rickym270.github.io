Github SSH Keygen

Sometimes when pushing to your github repository, theres an Authentication error. This is usually fixed by generating a private key.

If ~/.ssh doesn't exist, you need to run the following command in the command prompt
	ssh-keygen

Just click 'ENTER" every prompt to save in the default location (This tutorial will assume everything is in the default location).

After this is done, run the following command to get the ssh key.
	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the contents and continue to the next steps

On a browser, go to github.com and sign in.
Go to settings > SSH and GPG Keys.
Add an SSH Keygen
Write and appropriate title and in the 'key' section, paste the ssh-key value that you copied.
Click "Add SSH key"
