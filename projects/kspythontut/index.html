<h2>3: Conditionals</h2>
<i>If this is true, then this happens/is true.</i>

<h3>Small intro</h3>
    <p>Conditionals are a control structure. Control structures are used to change the flow of the code to executee
        instructions.</p>

<h3>The <b><i>if/else</i></b> statements</h3>
    {% highlight python %}
        if condition:
            instruction
    {% endhighlight %}
    </br>
    <p>The <b><i>if</i></b> statement is one of the simplest control structures. Assuming <b>condition</b> is a valid condition, if the <b>condition</b>
    evaluates to true, then <b>instruction</b> executes. If <b>condition</b> evaluates to false, <b>instruction</b> is skipped over and doesn't
    execute <i>(if else condition isn't specified/ present)</i></p>
    <p>The <i>else</i> statement is used with the <i>if</i> statement. Else is used to tell the code what to do if <b>condition</b> is False.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>{% highlight python %}
        x = 5               //This is known as a variable. If you dont really
                            // get this, please let me know so I could clarify.

        if x < 10:          //Evaluates to True because 5 is less than 10.
            print("True")       // This executes

        if x > 10:         // Evaluates to False. 5 is NOT greater than 10.
            print("False")      // This is skipped over and never executes

        if x == 5:         // Evaluates as True. 5 is equal to 5.
            print("True")       //This executes
    {% endhighlight %}</p>

<h2>2: Hello World!</h2>
<i>Extremely short but remember, this is an intro still</i>
<h3>Create project</h3>
<p>Start up PyCharm and create a new Project and name it PythonTutorial
<h3>Create file and code!</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Once the project is created, make a new file and title it, helloworld.py
    </li>
    <li>
        On line 1, type the following:
        
        {% highlight python %}
            print("Hello World!")
        {% endhighlight %}
    </li>
    <li>
        On the taskbar, find Run then click Run.
    </li>
    <li>
        A window should appear and it should say "Hello World"
    </li>
</ol>
<p> You've just built your first python program. It's small and simple but baby steps.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b></p>
<p>It's fairly easy to get lost in this so reach out to me or google, whenever you have a question. I may not know the answer
    but I'll find out for you.<small>Worst case scenario: Google it.</small></p>

<h2>1: Setting up</h2>
<i>This one is going to be annoying.</i>
</br></br>

<h3>Windows:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Get python3.8.2 from here:
            <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/">Get Python3.8.2</a>

        Choose the Windows x86-64 web-based installer and go through the installation. If at one point it asks if you 
        want to disable a MAX_PATH limitation, do it. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Download a program called “pycharm community edition.” 
            - From <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows">Get PyCharm for Windows</a>
        Download the free one.
    </li>
    <li>
        When installing pycharm, it’ll ask you to check some installation options. Just select “create desktop shortcut” and 
        “create associations.” Click continue and let the installer run. 
    
        When it finishes, click the option that says Run PyCharm Community Edition and then finish.
    </li>
    <li>
        At some point it’ll give two options, click the one that says “Do not import settings” 
        Agree to the terms if you agree, I guess
        Then click “Skip the remaining set to defaults” option when it’s prompted.
    </li>
</ol>

</br>
<h3>Apple Mac OSX</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Python comes preinstalled so no need to install it
    </li>
    <li>
        Download a program called “pycharm community edition.” 
            - From <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac">Get PyCharm for Mac</a>
        Download the free one.
    </li>
    <li>
        Run the installer and let the installer run. 
    </li>
    <li>
        When pycharm finishes installing, look for and run the program. It should be in your applications folder. 
    </li>
    <li>
        At some point it’ll give two options, click the one that says “Do not import settings” 
        Agree to the terms if you agree, I guess
        Then click “Skip the remaining set to defaults” option when it’s prompted. 
    </li>
</ol></br>
